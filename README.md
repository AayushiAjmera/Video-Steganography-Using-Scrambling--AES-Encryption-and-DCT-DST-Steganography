# Video-Steganography-Using-Scrambling--AES-Encryption-and-DCT-DST-Steganography
 Multimedia Steganography which enables working successfully with video files, without obscuring the quality of the resultant video. The proposed technique deals with Steganography in Transform domain, thus overcoming the drawbacks of the spatial domain techniques. An important drawback of spatial domain technique is that data is prone to different attacks, whereas Transform domain provides a robust aftermath. Applying the advantages of Transform domain, we have used DCT and DST technique on the cover video whilst using Encryption algorithm of Scrambling- AES on the message image, ensuring double layer security.
